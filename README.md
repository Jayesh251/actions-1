# GitHub Actions-1
It is a powerful and flexible automation platform provided by GitHub. It allows developers to automate the task directly from their repositories. We can quickly create the workflows to implement the CI/CD pipeline, that build test on every pull request and deploy the merged pull request to the production right beside your codebase.Out of the box, these steps can be
executed in different operating systems like ubuntu, windows and macos.

Another advantage of GitHub Actions is that GitHub manages the infrastructure for you, which includes setting up servers,scaling resources, and managing the execution environment for your workflows.

Your task is to write workflow configurations in YAML files, and GitHub Actions handles the rest.
This includes executing your tasks within virtual environments, caching necessary dependencies, and providing reports on the outcomes. Finally, this automation helps streamline development, reduce manual errors, and increase the efficiency of your software
development workflow.

Is GitHub Actions solely used for automating CICD pipelines for building, testing, and releasing code?

The answer is No, github actions goes beyond just CICD and lets you run workflows when other events happen in repository.It can automate all kinds of repository actions by listening to events such as push events, issues, pull requests, github
registry-packager, or whenever a issues or pull requests get updated etc.,
